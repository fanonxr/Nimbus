A Cannabis Delivery app concept. 

Boston University Host an annual Cannabis startup competition every year. I got the crazy idea to make a cannabis app where the user would be able to order their favorite types of marijuana and have it delivered to their door step. Right now this is just a concept that I plan to pursue once I flesh out the details. If your interested in this project/business Idea, please contribute to the project anyway you can!
